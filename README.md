COMP3015 coursework 2 

Visual Studio 2019 16.9.2 and a Windows 10 machine were used to write this code.

The exe is not working, please run the code through visual studio. 
For the program code, I have my phong shading done in the vertex shader. The uniform for lights and material were also done in the vertex shader.
In the scenebasic_uniform.cpp, I rendered a plane, added a tile texture and have 3 lights with a phong shading on the plane. 
I also attempted to implement noise and surface animation in the scenebasic_uniform.cpp. 
 
The project is an attempt to implement animation and noise. Which only half working. 
The other parts are working fine, by running the code, it would show a tile textured plane with 3 lights on it, paired with phong shading.
I started with the template given on the DLE. I rendered a plane, then I added 3 lights with a phong shading on it.
I also added a tile texture on the plane. Surface animation was then added in the code, althought the code still runs, there is no animation on the plane.
Lastly, noise was added in the code. The noise is not quite visible, but the debugger showed that it is indeed generated.

In conclusion, the project have working lights and shader, noise is not perfectly working and the surface animation is in the code but not showing yet.
If I have the chance to start over, I will probably start with a fresh project. I experienced many problems even when I carefully follow every step from the lab sessions.
As far as I can tell, a lot of the problems came from the bad practice in the coursework 1 codes. 
I learnt a lot from this coursework and I'm looking forward to use my experience on future projects.
